# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Guidelines

* Everyone in the group should ensure that they can be contacted easily by other members of the group by giving them adequate contact information
* When working in a group, please treat other members of the group with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if you do not necessarily agree with them
* You are expected to make a full and fair contribution to the work of the group
* When you agree to undertake a task that has been assigned to you by the group you must try work to the agreed deadline since failure to do so could impede the          progress of the whole project
* You have the right, naturally, to challenge other’s opinions but please try to do it in a non-aggressive way
* It is your responsibility to attend all meetings arranged by the group to advance the project, and to arrive at those meetings on time.  If you can’t attend a meeting of the group you should consider providing your input in written form and giving this to the other group members before the meeting
*	If another member of your group tells you something in confidence, you should respect their wishes
